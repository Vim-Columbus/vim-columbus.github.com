Vim Columbus is a monthly get-together of Vim users in Columbus, Ohio. Come
share your Vim knowledge and pick up a few tricks from others. Vim newbies
are welcome - just let us know that you're new to Vim so we can give you
some relevant information.

## Schedule

Vim Columbus meets the second Thursday of every month. The next meeting is
2011-07-14. There is a [Meetup.com group](http://www.meetup.com/Vim-Columbus/)
where you can RSVP.

## Location

It will be held at [2Checkout.com](http://www.2checkout.com/).

[1785 O'Brien Road<br>Columbus, OH 43228](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&aq=&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=1785+O%27Brien+Rd,+Columbus,+Ohio+43228&t=h&msa=0&msid=210175771168447127014.0004a3f81d50a68475a1f&ll=39.988798,-83.119957&spn=0.002713,0.005681&z=18)

Please enter through the door on the south side of the building next to the
"2Checkout Innovates" sign. (The south side is not the side that faces the
highway.)

## Format

We will start out with one or more talks about a feature or plugin for Vim,
maybe have a few people share some of their favorite Vim features, then break
into small groups to do [VimGolf](http://vimgolf.com). Bring a laptop if you
like.

We'll probably get a mailing list started soon, but for now you can direct any
questions to [@neall](https://twitter.com/neall) or
[@twymer](https://twitter.com/twymer) on Twitter.
