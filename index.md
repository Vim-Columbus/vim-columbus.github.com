Vim Columbus is a monthly get-together of Vim users in Columbus, Ohio. Come
share your Vim knowledge and pick up a few tricks from others. Vim newbies
are welcome - just let us know that you're new to Vim so we can give you
some relevant information.

## Schedule

Vim Columbus meets the second Thursday of every month. The next meeting is
2011-07-14. There is a [Meetup.com group](http://www.meetup.com/Vim-Columbus/)
where you can RSVP.

## Format

We will start out with one or more talks about a feature or plugin for Vim,
maybe have a few people share some of their favorite Vim features, then break
into small groups to do [VimGolf](http://vimgolf.com). Bring a laptop if you
like.

We'll probably get a mailing list started soon, but for now you can direct any
questions to [@neall](https://twitter.com/neall) or
[@twymer](https://twitter.com/twymer) on Twitter.
