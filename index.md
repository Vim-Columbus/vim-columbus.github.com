Vim Columbus is a monthly get-together of Vim users in Columbus, Ohio. Come
share your Vim knowledge and pick up a few tricks from others. Vim newbies
are welcome - just let us know that you're new to Vim so we can give you
some relevant information.

## Schedule

This month I will not be hosting Vim Columbus because I will be out of town.
Vim Columbus normally meets the second Thursday of every month. See you in
March!

## Location

New location coming soon.

## Format

We will start out with one or more talks about a feature or plugin for Vim,
maybe have a few people share some of their favorite Vim features, maybe break
into small groups to do [VimGolf](http://vimgolf.com). Bring a laptop if you
like.
