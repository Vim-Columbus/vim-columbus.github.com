Vim Columbus is a monthly get-together of Vim users in Columbus, Ohio. Come
share your Vim knowledge and pick up a few tricks from others. Vim newbies
are welcome - just let us know that you're new to Vim so we can give you
some relevant information.

## Schedule

Vim Columbus meets the second Thursday of every month.
<strike>The next meeting is 2012-08-09 at 6:30pm.</strike> Update: Vim
Columbus this month is being pre-empted in favor of the first-ever [Columbus
GitHub Drinkup](https://github.com/blog/1219-columbus-drinkup). We can still
talk about Vim.

There is a [vim-columbus group on Google
Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/vim-columbus) you can subscribe to for
updates, and you can follow [@vimcbus](https://twitter.com/vimcbus) on
Twitter.

like.
