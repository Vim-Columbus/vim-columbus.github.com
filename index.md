Vim Columbus is just a monthly get-together of Vim users in Columbus, Ohio.

## Schedule

The current plan is to meet the second Thursday of every month. The first
meeting will be an exception, being on the third Thursday (2011-06-16).

## Location

To be determined.

## Format

We will start out with someone giving a talk about a particular feature or
plugin for Vim, then break into small groups to do
[Vim Golf](http://vimgolf.com).

All of this is subject to change. We are just getting started!
