[1785 O'Brien Road<br>Columbus, OH 43228](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&aq=&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=1785+O%27Brien+Rd,+Columbus,+Ohio+43228&t=h&msa=0&msid=210175771168447127014.0004a3f81d50a68475a1f&ll=39.988798,-83.119957&spn=0.002713,0.005681&z=18)

## Format

We will start out with one or more talks about a feature or plugin for Vim,
then break into small groups to do [VimGolf](http://vimgolf.com). Bring a
laptop if you like.

We'll probably get a mailing list started soon, but for now you can direct any
questions to [@neall](https://twitter.com/neall) on Twitter.
